Starting with a "Hello World" project is a great way to familiarize yourself with unit testing, GitHub for version control, and Kanban for project management. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you set up a simple project using these tools:

## 1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary tools installed:

- **Git**: Version control system. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **IDE/Text Editor**: Such as VS Code, IntelliJ, or any editor you're comfortable with.
- **Programming Language**: Choose one (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java). This guide will use **Python** for simplicity.
- **Package Manager**: For Python, `pip` is standard.

## 2. **Create a GitHub Repository**

1. **Sign in to GitHub**: If you don't have an account, [sign up](https://github.com/join).
2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner and select **"New repository"**.
   - Name your repository, e.g., `hello-world-unit-testing`.
   - Add a description (optional).
   - Choose between **Public** or **Private**.
   - Initialize with a **README** (optional).
   - Click **"Create repository"**.

## 3. **Clone the Repository Locally**

Open your terminal or command prompt and execute:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hello-world-unit-testing.git
cd hello-world-unit-testing
```

*Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.*

## 4. **Create the "Hello World" Application**

For Python, create a simple script.

1. **Create a Python File**:

   ```bash
   touch hello.py
   ```

2. **Add Code to `hello.py`**:

   ```python
   def say_hello():
       return "Hello, World!"

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       print(say_hello())
   ```

## 5. **Set Up Unit Testing**

Using Python's built-in `unittest` framework.

1. **Create a Tests Directory**:

   ```bash
   mkdir tests
   touch tests/test_hello.py
   ```

2. **Add Unit Tests to `tests/test_hello.py`**:

   ```python
   import unittest
   from hello import say_hello

   class TestHello(unittest.TestCase):
       
       def test_say_hello(self):
           self.assertEqual(say_hello(), "Hello, World!")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       unittest.main()
   ```

3. **Run Tests Locally**:

   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```

   You should see an output indicating that the tests have passed.

## 6. **Commit and Push Changes to GitHub**

1. **Add Files to Git**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit Changes**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit with Hello World application and unit tests"
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## 7. **Set Up Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions**

Automate your tests to run on every push.

1. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**:

   - In your repository on GitHub, navigate to the **"Actions"** tab.
   - Click **"Set up a workflow yourself"** or choose a Python template.
   - Create a file named `.github/workflows/python-app.yml`.

2. **Add the Following Configuration to `python-app.yml`**:

   ```yaml
   name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
     - name: Checkout code
       uses: actions/checkout@v3
     - name: Set up Python
       uses: actions/setup-python@v4
       with:
         python-version: '3.x' 
     - name: Install dependencies
       run: |
         python -m pip install --upgrade pip
         pip install -r requirements.txt || echo "No requirements.txt found"
     - name: Run tests
       run: |
         python -m unittest discover test
   ```

3. **Commit the Workflow File**:

   Commit the new `python-app.yml` to `.github/workflows/`.

4. **Verify CI Runs**:

   - After pushing, go to the **"Actions"** tab to see your workflow running.
   - It should execute the unit tests automatically.

## 8. **Set Up Project Management with Kanban**

GitHub offers built-in project management tools, but you can also use external tools like Trello or Jira. Here, we'll use GitHub Projects.

1. **Navigate to Projects**:

   - In your repository, click on the **"Projects"** tab.
   - Click **"New Project"** and select **"Kanban (Basic)"**.

2. **Configure Columns**:

   - **To Do**: Tasks to be started.
   - **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
   - **Done**: Completed tasks.

3. **Add Issues as Tasks**:

   - Click **"Add cards"** and create issues representing tasks such as:
     - "Implement `say_hello` function"
     - "Write unit tests for `say_hello`"
     - "Set up GitHub Actions for CI"

4. **Organize and Move Tasks**:

   As you work on tasks, move the corresponding cards across the columns to track progress.

## 9. **Best Practices and Next Steps**

- **Branching Strategy**: Use branches like `feature/say-hello` for new features and merge them into `main` via pull requests after reviews.
- **Code Reviews**: Even for simple projects, practicing code reviews can help maintain quality.
- **Enhance Tests**: Add more unit tests or explore other testing frameworks like `pytest` for more features.
- **Documentation**: Keep your `README.md` updated with project details and instructions.
- **Expand Project**: As you grow more comfortable, expand your project with more functionalities and corresponding tests.

## **Conclusion**

By following these steps, you've set up a basic "Hello World" project with unit testing, integrated it with GitHub for version control, automated testing with GitHub Actions, and organized your workflow using a Kanban board. This foundation can be expanded as you take on more complex projects, incorporating additional best practices and tools as needed.
