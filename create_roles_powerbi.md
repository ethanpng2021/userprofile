Creating different user roles for a Power BI dashboard involves leveraging Power BI's Row-Level Security (RLS) feature. This allows you to restrict data access for different users by defining roles and rules within your Power BI reports. Here's how to set up RLS in Power BI:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Create User Roles:

1. **Open Power BI Desktop:**
   - Open your report in Power BI Desktop where you want to define roles.

2. **Define Roles:**
   - Go to the “Modeling” tab on the ribbon.
   - Click “Manage Roles.”
   - In the Manage Roles window, click “Create,” and enter a name for the role, such as “SalesTeam” or “Finance.”

3. **Set Role Rules:**
   - After creating a role, define the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) filter rules that specify what data the role can access. This is often a logical condition such as `[Region] = "North America"` or `[DepartmentID] = 123`.
   - Select a table to apply a DAX rule, and define your filter expression.

4. **Validate Your Role:**
   - Use the “View as Roles” button in the Modeling tab to test the roles. 
   - Select the roles, and click “OK” to view the report as if you were a member of that role.

5. **Publish the Report:**
   - Once you are satisfied with the effect of the roles, publish your Power BI report to the Power BI Service.

6. **Assign Roles in Power BI Service:**
   - After publishing, navigate to the Power BI Service (https://app.powerbi.com).
   - Go to the dataset associated with your report.
   - Click on the ellipsis (…) next to the dataset, and choose “Security.”

7. **Add Users to Roles:**
   - In the Security settings for the dataset, you will see the roles you defined in Power BI Desktop.
   - Click on a role to open it, and add individual users or groups from your organization who should be members of this role.

8. **Testing in the Power BI Service:**
   - After assigning roles, have the users log in to confirm they see only the data they are supposed to.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Dynamic Security:** For more advanced scenarios where rules are dynamic and based on user attributes, you can use DAX functions like `USERPRINCIPALNAME()` to create dynamic filters based on logged-in users' attributes.
  
- **Testing Permissions:** Always test and validate your roles thoroughly to ensure that users see only the data they should.

- **Role Limitations:** Role permissions are defined at the dataset level and are effective across all reports connected to that dataset.

- **Power BI Pro License:** Remember that, to implement RLS and share reports, you and your users may require Power BI Pro licenses, especially if using shared or premium capacities.

By following these steps, you can effectively create user roles in Power BI and manage data security across your Power BI reports and dashboards.
